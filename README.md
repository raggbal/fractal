<img src="media/icon.png" alt="Fractal" width="48" align="absmiddle"> Fractal - Markdown & Outliner Editor VS Code
=

A note app that lives in your VS Code Activity Bar. Add folders, organize outlines, write markdown pages — all without leaving the editor. Fractal combines a **Dynalist-like outliner** and a **Typora-like WYSIWYG markdown editor** into a single, integrated note-taking experience with Daily Notes, full-text search, and S3 cloud sync. The markdown editor is **AI-friendly** — edit visually while AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) modify the same file in real-time, with your edits and AI's edits coexisting safely.

Each `.out` (outliner) and `.md` (markdown) file also works standalone — but the real power is in the **Notes manager**, where everything comes together.

## Visual
### Outliner Editor
The Outliner Editor can be used by first adding a Note (any folder) from Fractal Notes in the VSCode Activity Bar.
The Outliner Editor is an outliner with features comparable to Dynalist and Workflowy. Additionally, you can structurally organize outline files using folders, and perform full-text search across both outline node text and Markdown content. You can also back up notes to S3 and restore them from S3.![assets/images/1775404974903.png](assets/images/1775404974903.png)

### Side Panel Markdown Editor
Each node in the outliner can easily embed a Markdown file as a page using the `@page` command. Nodes with an attached page display a page icon, and pressing Cmd+Enter opens the Markdown editor in the side panel.

### Markdown Editor (Standalone)
The Markdown editor can be launched in standalone mode from the side panel. The functionality is the same, but standalone mode offers the advantage of a larger editing area. It can also be set as the default Markdown editor, allowing you to edit any Markdown file with the Fractal Markdown editor.

## 🎬 Demo (gif)

You can freely use markdown using only the keyboard.
lists, tables, code blocks, and everything else! And when you want to request AI Chat, select the range and press cmd+l (ctr+l).

## 📦 Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for **"Fractal"**
4. Click **Install**

Or install directly: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=imaken.fractal)

### From Open VSX (VSCodium / Gitpod / Eclipse Theia)

[Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/imaken/fractal)

### From VSIX
```bash
code --install-extension fractal-{version}.vsix
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raggbal/fractal
cd fractal
npm install
npm run compile
# Press F5 to launch in debug mode
```

### Optional: AWS CLI (for S3 sync & Translation features)

Fractal itself works without AWS CLI. However, the following features require the AWS CLI (`aws` command) to be installed and available in PATH:

- **S3 sync** (Notes: sync notes folder to/from S3 bucket)
- **Translation** (MD editor: translate selected text or full document via Amazon Translate)

If AWS CLI is not installed, the core editor features (Markdown, Outliner, Notes management) work normally — only these two AWS-based features will show an error when invoked.

**Install AWS CLI:** https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

**Configure credentials** in VS Code settings:
- For S3 sync: `fractal.s3AccessKeyId`, `fractal.s3SecretAccessKey`, `fractal.s3Region`
- For Translation: `fractal.transAccessKeyId`, `fractal.transSecretAccessKey`, `fractal.transRegion`

## 💻 Code Block Features

### Supported Languages

The editor supports syntax highlighting for the following languages:

`javascript`, `typescript`, `python`, `json`, `bash`, `shell`, `css`, `html`, `xml`, `sql`, `java`, `go`, `rust`, `yaml`, `markdown`, `c`, `cpp`, `csharp`, `php`, `ruby`, `swift`, `kotlin`, `dockerfile`, `plaintext`

**Language Aliases:** `js`→javascript, `ts`→typescript, `py`→python, `sh`→bash, `yml`→yaml, `md`→markdown, `c++`→cpp, `c#`→csharp

### Display Mode / Edit Mode

- **Display Mode**: Shows syntax-highlighted code with language tag and copy button
- **Edit Mode**: Plain text editing (click on code block to enter)
- **Expand Button**: Open code in a separate VS Code editor tab for larger editing

### Mermaid Diagrams

Code blocks with language `mermaid` are rendered as diagrams:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```

- Click on diagram to edit source
- Diagram re-renders when exiting edit mode

### KaTeX Math Equations

Code blocks with language `math` are rendered as mathematical equations using KaTeX:

```math
E = mc^2
\int_0^\infty e^{-x} dx = 1
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
```

- Each line is rendered as an independent display-mode equation
- Click on the rendered equation to edit the LaTeX source
- Equations re-render automatically (500ms debounce) while editing
- Invalid LaTeX is shown as a red error message (does not break the layout)
- Empty blocks show "Empty expression"
- Navigate in/out with arrow keys, just like code blocks and Mermaid diagrams

## 🖼️ Image & File Path Configuration

Images and file attachments can be saved to custom directories when pasting or drag-and-dropping. The same path resolution rules apply to both.

### Configuration Levels

| Level | Setting File | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Global** | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` (macOS)<br>`%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json` (Windows)<br>`~/.config/Code/User/settings.json` (Linux) | VS Code user settings |
| **Project** | `.vscode/settings.json` | Project-level override |

### VS Code settings.json Setting

```json
{
  "fractal.imageDefaultDir": "./images",
  "fractal.forceRelativeImagePath": true,
  "fractal.fileDefaultDir": "./files",
  "fractal.forceRelativeFilePath": true
}
```

### Path Behavior Matrix

The `forceRelative` settings (`forceRelativeImagePath` / `forceRelativeFilePath`) allow you to separate the **save location** from the **path written in Markdown**.

**Use case**: When you want to save files to a specific absolute path but reference them using relative paths from the Markdown file, set this to `true`.

> **Note**: `forceRelative` only takes effect when the directory setting is an absolute path. When using relative paths, the setting is ignored as paths are always relative.

The same rules apply to both images and file attachments:

| Directory Setting | forceRelative | Save Location | Path in Markdown |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Absolute (e.g., `/Users/shared/images`) | `false` (default) | Specified absolute path | Absolute path |
| Absolute (e.g., `/Users/shared/images`) | `true` | Specified absolute path | Relative path from Markdown file |
| Relative (e.g., `./images`) | `false` | Relative to Markdown file | Relative path |
| Relative (e.g., `./images`) | `true` | Relative to Markdown file | Relative path (setting ignored) |

---

## 🎨 Configuration

### VS Code Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fractal.theme` | Editor theme (`github`, `sepia`, `night`, `dark`, `minimal`, `perplexity`, `things`) | `things` |
| `fractal.fontSize` | Base font size (px) | `16` |
| `fractal.imageDefaultDir` | Default directory for saved images | `""` (same as markdown file) |
| `fractal.forceRelativeImagePath` | Force relative paths for images | `false` |
| `fractal.language` | UI language (`default`, `en`, `ja`, `zh-cn`, `zh-tw`, `ko`, `es`, `fr`) | `default` |
| `fractal.toolbarMode` | Toolbar display mode (`full`, `simple`) | `simple` |
| `fractal.outlinerPageDir` | Default page directory for outliner | `./pages` |
| `fractal.outlinerPageTitle` | Show page title input in outliner | `false` |
| `fractal.outlinerImageDefaultDir` | Default image directory for outliner nodes | `./images` |
| `fractal.outlinerFileDir` | Default file attachment directory for outliner nodes | `./files` |
| `fractal.fileDefaultDir` | Default directory for file attachments in markdown | `""` (same as markdown file) |
| `fractal.forceRelativeFilePath` | Force relative paths for file attachments | `false` |
| `fractal.enableDebugLogging` | Enable debug logging in browser console | `false` |

### Themes

All 7 themes apply to both the markdown editor and the outliner:

| Theme | Description |
| --- | --- |

| Japanese | `ja` |
| Simplified Chinese | `zh-cn` |
| Traditional Chinese | `zh-tw` |
| Korean | `ko` |

---

## 🔄 External File Changes

When another tool (e.g., AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) modifies the same markdown file while you have it open in Fractal:

- **Block-level DOM diff**: Only changed blocks are updated — your cursor position and in-progress edits are preserved.
- **Toast notification**: A notification appears allowing you to review and accept or dismiss external changes.
- **Unsaved changes warning**: If you have unsaved edits, a confirmation dialog prevents accidental overwrites.
